What's needed to change:

- Dont have to go over every minute detail
	o Just support one central arguement

- Why show maximum distance? It's not relevent (we're looking for small distance)
	o Want to minimize communication
		* remove Tx range column and find minimum range if possible
	o More focus on minimum distance

- Set Tx Power and Rx ensitivity to minimum values

- Be careful with resolutions
	o Approximate values to whole numbers only (unless absolutely necessary)

- Put module names in the standards chart 1 so the ranges make sense, or find standard given ranges

- Make sure BLE provides reasonable numbers for all parts of chart 1

- Either fix or explain Bluetooth's 100ms latency

- BLE payload: up to 27 bytes; Bluetooth payload: up to 251 bytes

- Add reasons as to why BLE is better than Zigbee
	o BLE frequency hop
	o BLE less power
	o BLE faster
	o GATT makes BLE nice
	o BLE has star networking capability and mesh being developed
		* Zigbee has only mesh

- Cite Throughputs

- Change some "communication"s to "interface"s and "RF" to "wireless" or "radio"

- Fix Title & abstract
	o Adam is doing the abstract

- Add some pictures & captions
	o Give breif summary with the captions
	o More detail & description to each picture caption

- Too many pages, optimize redundant information

- Add acknowledgement for NJS

- PC/104 needs to be excluded from keywords
	o Target low power, low latency, wireless, Bluetooth

- Spellcheck

- Change volumes to area
